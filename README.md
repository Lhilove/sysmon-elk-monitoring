# 🛡️ Sysmon + Winlogbeat + ELK: Windows Threat Detection Pipeline

**Turn raw Windows logs into real-time threat intelligence.**  
This project walks you through deploying a complete endpoint detection pipeline using **Sysmon**, **Winlogbeat**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Kibana** — all on a local Windows machine.

Whether you're a blue teamer, student, or home lab enthusiast, this setup helps you monitor and analyze detailed Windows telemetry like process creations, network activity, and registry changes.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- How to install and configure **Sysmon** for deep system monitoring
- How to forward logs securely with **Winlogbeat**
- How to search, visualize, and alert on events using the **ELK Stack**
- How to use real Windows telemetry to build a basic **SIEM**

## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

Most default Windows logs don’t tell the full story. Sysmon fills the gap — and with a proper pipeline, you gain the visibility needed for:

- Threat hunting 🐾  
- Malware analysis 🦠  
- Incident response 🚨  
- Blue team lab setups 🔬
